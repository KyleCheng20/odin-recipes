        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Spam fried rice is a quick, flavorful stir-fry that transforms simple ingredients into a satisfying meal. It typically features diced Spam that’s pan-fried until crispy, then tossed with cooked rice, scrambled eggs, vegetables like peas, carrots, or green onions, and seasoned with soy sauce or other savory sauces. The salty, savory richness of Spam pairs perfectly with the fluffy rice and fresh vegetables, making it both comforting and versatile. Popular in Hawaii and across parts of Asia, it's a budget-friendly, easy-to-make dish that works well as a main course or a side.
