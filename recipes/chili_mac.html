        <p>
            Chili mac is a hearty comfort food that combines elements of chili and macaroni and cheese into a single dish. It typically features elbow macaroni mixed with a savory, seasoned chili made from ground beef (or turkey), beans, tomatoes, and spices like chili powder, cumin, and paprika. 
            Some versions also include cheese, either stirred in for creaminess or melted on top for extra richness. The result is a filling, flavorful meal that's both budget-friendly and easy to make, often served as a family dinner, potluck dish, or quick weeknight option.
