        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Red beans and rice is a classic Creole and Southern dish known for its comforting, hearty flavors. Traditionally made with red beans simmered slowly with onions, bell peppers, celery, garlic, and smoky seasonings—often including ham hocks, sausage, or andouille—it develops a rich, savory taste as the beans cook down into a creamy texture. Served over a bed of fluffy white rice, the dish is both filling and flavorful, carrying a balance of spice and warmth. It’s a staple of Louisiana cuisine, often enjoyed as a weekday meal or shared at gatherings.
